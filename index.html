      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Main article: History of surgery Al-Zahrawi, the Islamic Golden Age
        physician widely considered one of the '"Fathers of Modern Surgery" The
        first person to document a surgery was the 6th century BC Indian
        physician-surgeon, Sushruta. He specialized in cosmetic plastic surgery
        and even documented an open rhinoplasty procedure. His magnum opus
        Suśruta-saṃhitā is one of the most important surviving ancient treatises
        on medicine and is considered a foundational text of both Ayurveda and
        surgery. The treatise addresses all aspects of general medicine, but the
        translator G. D. Singhal dubbed Sushruta "the father of surgical
        intervention" on account of the extraordinarily accurate and detailed
        accounts of surgery to be found in the work. After the eventual decline
        of the Sushruta School of Medicine in India, surgery was largely ignored
        until the Islamic Golden Age surgeon Al-Zahrawi (936–1013)
        re-established surgery as an effective medical practice. He is
        considered the greatest medieval surgeon to have appeared from the
        Islamic World, and has also been described as the father of surgery. His
        greatest contribution to medicine is the Kitab al-Tasrif, a
        thirty-volume encyclopedia of medical practices. He was the first
        physician to describe an ectopic pregnancy, and the first physician to
        identify the hereditary nature of haemophilia. His pioneering
        contributions to the field of surgical procedures and instruments had an
        enormous impact on surgery but it was not until the 18th century that
        surgery emerged as a distinct medical discipline in England. In Europe,
        surgery was mostly associated with barber-surgeons who also used their
        hair-cutting tools to undertake surgical procedures, often at the
        battlefield and also for their employers. With advances in medicine and
        physiology, the professions of barbers and surgeons diverged; by the
        19th century barber-surgeons had virtually disappeared, and surgeons
        were almost invariably qualified doctors who had specialized in surgery.
        Surgeon continued, however, to be used as the title for military medical
        officers until the end of the 19th century, and the title of Surgeon
        General continues to exist for both senior military medical officers and
        senior government public health officers.
