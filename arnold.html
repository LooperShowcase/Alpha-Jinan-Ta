     <h2>Personal life</h2>
     <p> Rich was Jewish. His father Samuel Rice was an Ashkenazi immigrant from Košice in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (present day Slovakia), while his mother was a Sephardi Jew from Vicksburg, Mississippi. Samuel Rice owned a successful shoe store in Birmingham. In 1925 Arnold married the pianist and composer Helen Jones. They had two daughters: the poet Adrienne Rich (1929-2012 ) and the writer Cynthia Rich (1933- ). Arnold Rice Rich died April 17, 1968, in Baltimore, Maryland.Through other research efforts, Rich was among the first to describe the high prevalence of occult cancer of the prostate in elderly men, the first to describe lymphoid polypoidal structures in kidney tubules which he attributed to syphilis, and the first to describe widespread pulmonary vascular obstruction in children with tetralogy of Fallot. With his long time clinical associate Louis Hamman, he described a unique pulmonary interstitial lesion as part of what has become known as the Hamman-Rich syndrome. He also discovered the phagocytic function of the Gaucher cell, the hallmark of Gaucher’s disease.   
        Rich contributed his expertise to the Chemical Warfare Service, the Surgeon General of the Army, and the Tuberculosis Control Division of the US Public Health Service. His research and practice garnered him many honors. He was a member of the National Research Council from 1947 to 1952. In 1951, he became the Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Armed Forces Insitutes of Pathology. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1954. His awards include the Kober Medal of the Association of American Physicians, the Gordon Wilson Medal of the American Clinical and Climatological Association, and the Trudeau Medal of the National Tuberculosis Association.
